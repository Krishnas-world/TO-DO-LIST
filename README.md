# TO-DO-LIST
This is a simple web-based to-do list application that allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks.

Store tasks locally in the user's browser using localStorage.
Display tasks in a list format.
Delete tasks individually.

# How it works:

Each task is assigned a unique ID based on the current timestamp.

Users can delete tasks by clicking the "X" button next to each task.
The task list is dynamically updated as tasks are added or removed.
